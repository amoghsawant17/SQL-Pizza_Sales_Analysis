## Problem Statement
As part of a pizza chain's business analysis, we aim to analyze sales data to gain insights into customer preferences and revenue generation. This analysis will help in understanding order patterns, identifying popular pizza types, and making informed strategic decisions to enhance sales and customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a pizza sales dataset using SQL. The dataset comprises four main tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. The primary objective is to extract valuable information regarding order patterns, revenue generation, popular pizza types, and more. This analysis will support key decision-making processes for the pizza chain.
